# SystemArchitecture
This will only run correctly in Linux. To launch the files generated with the default application xdg-open needs to
be installed; I believe Linux Mint 17.1 comes with this installed by default. Running the SystemArchitecture exectubale will kill the desktop process as well. (The desktop stays up if run from CLion, and probably other IDEs as well.)
